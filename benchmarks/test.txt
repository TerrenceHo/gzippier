See, if you had anything to say about humanity, you’d say that you were all morbid little fuckers.  Everyone spent an awful amount of time imagining the ways they’d all die, or otherwise be subjected to horrible, horrible fates.  Dystopia was a thing, like people got off on imagining how much worse life could get. 

Not global warming and radiation and pandemics.  Those were plausible. Plausibility was boring.  Nah, people moved on to zombies and unspeakable outer gods and theoretical apocalypses dreamed up by civilizations thousands of years dead.

You’d think that by how quickly everyone got bored of realism that it meant that humanity had maybe solved the normal problems already. World hunger and solar flares and all that.

Haha.  No.  Not really.

You’d fallen asleep one day, and when you woke up from your nap, you had looked out the window to find that everyone was on fire. The sun was a bright, raging thing in the sky.  There were screams.  There were flames.  There were corpses in the streets.

Welcome to the end of the world.  Yes, really this time.

Of course, you didn’t know that.  You thought you were dreaming and that you weren’t awake enough to deal with this, so you shut the blinds, rolled over, and went back to sleep.

“Huh,” you had said when you woke up a few hours later. You were disappointed to find the world exactly the same as it was before you’d left it for blessed unconsciousness.
Right.
